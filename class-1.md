## What I have learned today

    A lot of today's reading was a recap and refresher from the 102 class, so a not a lot of "new" learning for me.

    I did however learn how to use some elements in HTML which were not covered in 102. The reading did also broadly covered topics like DNS and internet infrastructure. A few of the elements that I learned are as follows:

- Aside:acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone.It is typically used inside an article or on it's own.

- Section: The section element groups related content together and has it's own heading

  - hgroup: It's purpose is to group together a set of headers.

  - Figure: The figure element or figcaption can be used to contain content that is referenced from the main flow of an article. It should only be used when the content references the element.

  - Div: The div element, though not used as much in HTML5 is still useful for grouping together related elements.

## Things I want to know about

  - How IDs and classes work with loops.
