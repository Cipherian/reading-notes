## What I have learned today

- Today I read about images, color and text in HTML. As well as learning different things like the difference between jpegs, pngs, gifs, svg and other files.

- There are multiple ways of altering color in an html page. RGB, hex codes, HSL (hue,saturation, light/brightness)

- You can alter opacity with "opacity". A value of 0.5 is equivalent to 50% opacity.

- We also learned about typefont and choosing a typeface for a website.

> Serif fonts have extra details on the end of the main strokes of the letter.
> Sans-Serif fonts have straight ends to letters and therefore have much cleaner design.
> As a result, sites often use a small set of typefaces that are installed on most computers. There are some technologies to get around the limitation. (P.269, HTML and CSS, Duckett)

- Techniques that offer a wider choice of type of typefaces include: font-family, font-face, servoce-basedfont-face

> If you design on a Mac, it is important to check what the typefaces look like on a PC because PCs can render type less smoothly. But if you design on a PC, then it should look fine on a Mac. (P. 272, HTML & CSS, DUCKETT)
