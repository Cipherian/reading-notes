## What I have learned today

- Today I learned a lot about selectors. Universal, type, class and id selectors are selectors which I read about in 102. 

- Child Selector: li>a ()

> Matches an element that is a direct child of another

- Descendant selector: p a ()

> Matches an element that is a descendent of another specified element (not just a direct child of that element)

- Adjacemt sibling selector: p a li>a ()

> Matches an element that is the next sibling of another

- General sibling selector: h1-p ()

> Matches an element that is a sibling of another, although it does not have to be the directly preceding element.
