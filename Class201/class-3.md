## What I have learned today

- I read about lists in the html book today, which I felt like I had a pretty good grasp on. The reading did cover nesting lists, which in my about-me I learned about nesting from David Souther. I learned that nesting undordered lists within eachother changes the graphics of the nested lists.

- I also learned about <!--<dl> <dt> and <dd>-->

> The definition of DL consists of a series of terms and their definitions. (Html and &, Duckett)
> DT is used to contain the term being defined (Html & CSS, Duckett)
> DD contains the definition. (Html & CSS, Duckett)

- I also learned a lot of of useful CSS functions in chapter 13 of the ducket book. They include min-width, max-width, min-height, max-height., overflow:hidden;, overflow: scroll, border-width.

- The order is border, margin, padding.

- I also learned about creating arrays. Here is a sample array

> <!--let colors = [white', 'black','custom']; -->
> <!--var el = document.getElementbyId('colors);-->
> <!--el.textContent = oolors[0]-->

-

> Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). (Pg.72, Javascript and Jquery, Duckett )

- I also learned about type coercion as well as weak typing versus strong typing.

> Javascript is said to use ewak typing because the data type for a value can change. Some other languages require that you specify what data type each variable will be. They are said to use strong typing. (Pg.166, Javascript and Jquery, Dukett.)

- Falsy variables are treated as is they are false, truthy variables are treated as if they were true.

- false == 0 evaluates true 

- false === 0 evaluates false

- This is due to type coercion
