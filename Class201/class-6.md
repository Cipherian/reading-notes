## What I have learned today

> Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
> (Pg. 100, JS & Jquery, Duckett)

- Today I learned about objects

- If a variable is part of an objefct it is called a property.

- Property tells about an object, such as age, name or location. In an object functions become known as methods.

- Methods represent tasks that are associated within an object.

<!-- > var hotel = {
  name: 'Quay',
  rooms: 40,
  booked: 25,
  gym: true,
  roomTypes: ['twin', 'double', 'suite'],
  check Availability: function() {
    return this.rooms - this.booked;
  }
}; -->

- In the about object you have the keys which are: name, rooms, booked, gym, roomtypes.

- The method is checkAvailability function.

- Literal notation is the easiest way to create more objects.

- You can access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation. You can also access properties using square brackets.

<!-- > let hotelName = hotel.name;
  let roomsFree = hotel.checkAvailability();

  let hotelName = hotel['name'] -->

- Today I also learned about the DOM(document object model) tree. Which is the layout of a webpage and is stored in the browsers memory.

- Methods that find elements in the Dom tree are called DOM queries. Such as getElemenById('one');

> let itemOne = getElementByID('one');

- Some other elements include querySelector, getElementsbyClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelectorAll.
