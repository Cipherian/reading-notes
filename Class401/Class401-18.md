## Django

> A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality web application. Django encourages beautiful URL design and doesnâ€™t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp.

- To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.

- Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

- Django comes with a lot of built-in features, such as a user authentication system, a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for interacting with databases, and tools for handling common web development tasks such as routing, handling requests and responses, and templating.

- To start a new Django project, you can use the django-admin startproject command, which creates a new directory with the necessary files and directory structure for a Django project.

- Django uses a model-template-view (MTV) architecture, where the model represents the data, the template defines the user interface, and the view handles the interaction between the model and the template.

- Django uses a URLconf (URL configuration) to specify the mapping between URL patterns and views. You can define URL patterns in the urls.py file of your app.

- Django templates use a language called Django template language (DTL) to define the structure and layout of a webpage. You can use template tags and variables to include dynamic content in your templates.

- You can use Django's built-in testing framework to write unit tests for your code and ensure that it works as expected.

- Django also provides tools for deploying your application to a web server, such as the collectstatic command for collecting static files and the runserver command for testing your application locally.
