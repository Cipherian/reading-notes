# Reading Notes 1/10/2023

- This test provides a basic tutorial on how to implement a custom user model in a Django project. It explains that while Django ships with a built-in User model for authentication, it is recommended to use a custom user model for more flexibility in real-world projects.

- The tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a new -

- Django project and set up a custom user model. The steps include:

- Creating and navigating into a directory called accounts for the code.

- Installing Django.

- Creating a new Django project called django_project.

- Creating a new app called accounts.
Starting the local web server.

- The tutorial also provides the specific commands to run for Windows and MacOS users.

## AbstractUser

> AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser
There are two modern ways to create a custom user model in Django: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser. In both cases we can subclass them to extend existing functionality however AbstractBaseUser requires much, much more work. Seriously, don't mess with it unless you really know what you're doing. And if you did, you wouldn't be reading this tutorial, would you?

## Custom User

> Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

- update django_project/settings.py

- create a new CustomUser model

- create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm

- update the admin
