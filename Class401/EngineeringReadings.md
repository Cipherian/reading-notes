# Engineering Readings

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- While I don't know if this is completely unique to myself, I have a lot of experience reading and reading through game server data. This has given me the ability to troubleshoot and read through code quickly to help others and find bugs.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- Take a walk and do some deep breathing exercises.

- Look at other examples, google, stack overflow or things I have previously worked on.

- Consult a friend or mentor
