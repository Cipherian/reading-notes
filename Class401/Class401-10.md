## Stack Ques

- What is a Stack?

> A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

- Stacks follow the concept FILO: First In Last Out

- The first item added to the stack will be the last item popped out of the stacck

- LIFO: This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack

## Pushing

> Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack
> When adding a Node, you push it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its next property equal to the original top.
> Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.

## Peek

> When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

## Queue

- FIFO: First in First Out

- LILO: Last in Last Out

>When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.
> When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.
