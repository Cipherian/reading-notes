# Purpose Practice

- 1. What motivates me to get up
   in the morning?

Coffee, my grandparents, books, video-games, traveling, walking/hiking.

- 2. What keeps me up at night?

Geo politics and worrying about Seattle traffic.

- 3. What am I doing when Iâ€™m
   at my best?

Reading, studying, playing video games.

- 4. Why am I bothered by what
   bothers me?

  My tolerance for irritation is quite high from growing up with two younger sisters. What bothers me is usually impatience, or people who can't mantain basic civility. Or people who complain about things, only to do those things.

- 5. Why do I do the work I do?

  If this question is why I'm trying to get into coding, then it's because I want to have a job where I need to use my brain and not overly repetitive. Also, I like being creative and if I have to work long hours then it would be nice to get a better monetary reward for it. Also, I just enjoy coding.

- 6. Why do I live where I live?

  Born and raised in Seattle. I like the weather and I like the vast forests.

- 7. Why do I buy what I buy?

  I prefer to buy things that are reliable and don't need to be replaced a lot. Like Sennheiser headphones. As far as food goes, I try to buy organic in order to minimize the amount of glyphosate intake.

- 8. Why do I long for what I long for?

  Another vague question, which probably has its roots in evolutionary biology. I long for companionship and a place in society because I have been programmed to.

- 9. Why do I read and watch what I do?
  I largely read medieval fantasy and science fiction because those are what interest me. I occasionally dip into Non-Fiction depending on the topic.

- 10. Why do I admire whom I admire?
  I try to avoid admiring people or putting people up on pedestals. I admire people who I believe had or have foresight like Philip K Dick, Kurt Vonnegut, etc.

- 11. When am I happy?
  When I'm not in Seattle traffic and when I'm not being forced to listen to my family's political opinions.

- 12. Why do I have the relationships that I have?

  Most relationships I have are family or friends that I have grown up with. I don't tend to branch out much.
