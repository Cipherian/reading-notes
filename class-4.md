## What I have learned today

- Today I learned about functions and how to declare a function with the syntax "function myFunction()", within these parenthesis are the parameters which are needed if the function will need to use them. For example function myFunction(width, height)
let area = width * height
return;

- Also learned about making links within html. Including how to make links that link to email.=, or in a new window. EX: <!--< a href"http://wwww.imdb.com" target="_blank"-->.

- URL stands for uniform resource locator.

> On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder.(Page 81, HTML & CSS, Duckett)

- I also learned a lot new ways to control position in CSS: position:static/relative/absolute/fixed, z-index, float, clear.

-There are multiple type of layouts: liquid layouts, fixed-width.
