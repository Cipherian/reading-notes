## What I have learned today

- Today's reading was largely a rehash of what we had read before on CSS and formatting.

- display inline behave like words in a sentence. Elements like p and spand are inline by default.

- display block: block elements do not sit beside each other. They create a new line for themselves.

- display flex:

> The display property also determines how an element's children should behave. For example, setting the display property to display: flex makes the box a block-level box, and also converts its children to flex items. This enables the flex properties that control alignment, ordering and flow.

- Flexbox and grid are the two main areas that control layout

- Flexbox is a layout for one dimensional objects

- Items will stay on the same axis and not wrap when they run out of space. This can be changed with align-items, justify-content.

-grid is similar to flexbox but is designed to control multi access layouts

- if not using grid or flexbox your elements display in normal flow. Display inline block gives you some of the characters of a block element.
