## What I have learned today

- Today I learned about operators and loops!

- There are many different types of operators: assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, conditional, comma, unary and relational.

- Assignment operators include functions such as: assignment x=f(), addition assignment x += f(), subtraction assignment x -= f() and much more.

- Assignments are nested within a variable declaratopm such as const, let,var.

- Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. 

> You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:

> for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}

- There are many kinds of loops: for, do, while, labeled, break, etc.

- A for loop repeatings until a specified condition is proven to be false.
