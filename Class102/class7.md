## What I have learned today

- I learned a lot more about java script and functions today

- Javascript functions is defined by the function() keyword.

- Parameters are listend inside the parantheses, inside the function the arguments behave as variables. Outside of the function they return to normal.

- Functions in order to work properly need to be invoked

> When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)

-When Java reaches the return statement the function will stop executing.

-Functions will often compute a return value.

-Functions allow you to reuse code multiple times.
