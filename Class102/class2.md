## What I have learned today

- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

- A shell is what determines how the operating system will behave and look after running

  - Linux is full of shortcuts to help make your life easier
  - ls is short for list
  - The brackets mean it is optional `[options] [location]`
  - Under the hood in Linux everything is a file
  - Linux is an extensionless system
  - Linux is case sensitive
