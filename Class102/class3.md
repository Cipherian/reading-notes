## What I learned from today's reading notes about Git.

-You can edit files on your local computer and send the changes to a conglomerate site known as github without having actually visited the webpage.

- Git was originally known as something called Bitkeeper, but in 2002 the chief architect Linus Torvalds began creating what was known as Git.

- Git is what's known as a CVS or centralized version control. This is the history of CVS as detailed by blog.udemy.com.

> Centralized Version Control
The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS). This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. This streamlined the collaboration process (by eliminating the need to involve all local databases), allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team membersâ€™ activities with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.

- To sum it all up, Git is a DVCS that stores files as snapshots. Each time your project is saved, that is called a commit.

- Because it snapshots your files, Git is a remarkable way to prevent any data loss.
