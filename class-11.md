## What I have learned today

- Today I learned more about styling images in CSS.

- You can style images in CSS with width and height. You can align them with "align", for example "align-center", "align-left".

- Background image is a property that allows you to place an image behind any html element.

- When an image is not being repeated you can use the background position property to specify where a background image should be placed. For example, "background-position: center top;

- It is possible to create a link or a button that changes to a second style rollover or :hover.

> Search engine optimization is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.

> On page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines

> Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours.

- There are seven key places where keywords can appear to improve it's findability.

- Title, web address, headings, text, link text, image alt text, page descriptions.
