## What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

> Create, Read, Update, and Delete — CRUD — are the four major functions for interacting with database applications. CRUD functions often play a role in web-based REST APIs, where they map (albeit poorly) to the HTTP methods GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, and PATCH. Importantly, REST APIs can still expose functionality not corresponding to CRUD, so long as they use the appropriate HTTP method. (https://nordicapis.com/crud-vs-rest-whats-the-difference/)

## If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

> Client-Server: The client and server act independently.
Stateless: The server does not record the state of the client.
Cacheable: The server marks whether data is cacheable.
Uniform Interface: The client and server interact in a uniform and predictable way. An important aspect of this is that the server exposes resources.
Layered System: The application behaves the same regardless of any intermediaries between the client and server. (https://nordicapis.com/crud-vs-rest-whats-the-difference/)
