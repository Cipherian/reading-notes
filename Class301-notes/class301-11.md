## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? Give a real world example

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data. SQL databases are vertically scalable. SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data.

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? Give a real world example

-NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

- NoSQL

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

-SQL

## What does SQL stand for?

- Structured query language

## What is a relational database?

- A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.(oracle.com)

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

- PHP, apache, node.js

## What is a ‘schema’? 

> A database schema defines how data is organized within a relational database; this is inclusive of logical constraints such as, table names, fields, data types, and the relationships between these entities. (ibm.com)

## What is a NoSQL database?

- NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

## How does it work?

- NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

## What is inside of a Mongo database?

> Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB?

> MongoDB is a document-based non-relational database management system. It’s also called an object-based system. It was designed to supplant the MySQL structure as an easier way to work with data. 

On the other hand, MySQL is a table-based system (or open-source relational database). The table-based design is the data query structure for search and is considered an SQL database. Also, data is searchable and accessible in relation to another data point or set.

As data management and data volume needs grew, businesses began to perceive MySQL as a more rigid architecture and not as flexible for reformatting data structures. This sentiment is largely due to the table-based design, which enables sites and apps to apply a finite set of multivariate search queries. (IBM)

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

- Lack of standarization. Cross-platform support. Poor usability.
