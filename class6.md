## What I learned today

-Today I learned a lot about Javascript! JS is well known as the scripting language of webpages, it also js used in node.js, adobe, phones and much much more.

- Javascript and Java programming lnaguaes are different.

> Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.

- Today I learned several java script functions, a few of them can be display in my [index.html](https://cipherian.github.io/index/)

- I also learned how to functions such as: const, let, else, console.log, document.print the button function and how to ascribe a function to the button function using JS.
