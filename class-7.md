- These properties include document.title, document.lastModiefied, document.URL, document.domain.

- Some methods include document.write, document.getElementById, document.querySelectorAll(), document.createElement, document.createTextNode(), 

- In the reading there is a lot of new global objects. These are string objects: lenth, toUppercase, toLowerCase, charAt(), indexOf, lastIndexOf(), substring, split(), trim(), replace(

- Number Objects : isNaN (not a number), toFixed(), toPrecision(), toExponential()

- Today we also learned about decimal numbers! Many decimals get returned as a string because it cannot be always be accurately represented using floating point numbers.

- Some other math objects: Math.PI, Math.round, Math.sqrt, Math.ceil, Math.floor, Math.random.

- Date Objects: getDate(), getDay(), getFullYear(), getHours, GetMilliseconds(), getMinutes(),getMonth()

- Examples: let today = new Date();

- In the html reading, learned some new HTML functions
